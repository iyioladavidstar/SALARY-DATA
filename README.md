# SALARY-DATA
This dataset contains information about employee demographics, job roles, and salaries across different industries. It can be used for salary prediction, workforce analytics, and HR insights.

📊 Salary Data Analysis Using Excel
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes employee salary data to examine how demographic and professional factors influence salary levels. Using Microsoft Excel, the study applies Pivot Tables, descriptive statistics, and multiple linear regression concepts to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships within the data.

The project is designed for academic, learning, and beginner data analysis purposes, especially for students studying statistics, economics, or data analytics.

Years of Experience	Total years of work experience
Salary	Annual salary of the employee
🎓 Education Code Mapping

1 = Bachelor’s Degree

2 = Master’s Degree

3 = PhD

🎯 Objectives of the Study

To summarize salary distribution among employees

To examine the effect of experience on salary

To analyze salary differences based on gender

To evaluate how education level and job title influence salary

To prepare variables for multiple linear regression analysis

❓ Research Questions and Interpretation
1. What is the average, minimum, and maximum salary of employees?

Interpretation:
Using Pivot Tables, salary summary statistics provide a general understanding of income distribution. The average salary represents the typical earning level, while the minimum and maximum salaries indicate income inequality within the organization.

Conclusion:
Employee salaries vary significantly, suggesting differences in experience, education, and job roles contribute to income disparities.

2. How does years of experience affect salary levels?

Interpretation:
Pivot Table analysis shows that employees with more years of experience generally earn higher salaries. Salary tends to increase progressively as experience increases.

Conclusion:
There is a positive relationship between years of experience and salary. More experienced employees are compensated with higher pay.

3. Is there a significant difference in salary between male and female employees?

Interpretation:
Comparing average salaries by gender using Pivot Tables reveals whether one gender earns more on average than the other.

Conclusion:
Any observed salary difference may indicate gender-based pay variation, though further statistical testing would be required to confirm significance.

4. What is the effect of education level on employee salary?

Interpretation:
Employees with higher educational qualifications (Master’s and PhD) show higher average salaries compared to those with Bachelor’s degrees.

Conclusion:
Education level has a positive effect on salary. Higher academic qualifications are associated with higher earnings.

5. How does job title influence salary variation?

Interpretation:
Salary analysis by job title shows that senior or specialized roles earn significantly more than entry-level positions.

Conclusion:
Job title is a strong determinant of salary, reflecting responsibility level and skill requirements.

6. Does age significantly influence salary after controlling for experience and education?

Interpretation:
When age is considered alongside experience and education, its direct effect on salary appears weaker than experience.

Conclusion:
Age alone does not strongly determine salary; experience and education play more critical roles.
